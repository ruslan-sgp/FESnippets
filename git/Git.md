Below is a list of essential Git commands with brief explanations:

### 2. **`git clone <repository-url>`**
   - **Usage**: Copies an existing Git repository from a remote server (like GitHub) to your local machine.
   - **Comment**: Great for downloading a project to contribute to or continue working on.

   - **Comment**: If you no longer need a file in your project, this command deletes it and prepares the change for commit.

### 14. **`git stash`**

### Integrating Git with VS Code
- **Source Control Panel**: Use VS Code’s built-in Source Control panel to visualize and manage Git actions like staging, committing, and pushing changes.
- **GitLens Extension**: Consider installing the GitLens extension in VS Code for enhanced Git insights directly in your editor.

These commands form the foundation of using Git for version control.
